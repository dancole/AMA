# dancole/ama

A repository to ask [@dancole](https://twitter.com/dancole) anything.

Life is short. Life is too short for bullshit. I think we all need to figure out what we love to do and what we hate to do. Thing we hate to do should be removed from our list of activities. Read [Life is Short](http://paulgraham.com/vb.html). "Relentlessly prune bullshit, don't wait to do things that matter, and savor the time you have. That's what you do when life is short." ~ Paul Graham

I think automation is great. I'm an engineer. I always have been, at least as long as I can remember and I remember when I was five. Back then I played with Lego, snow, and sand. I started using Autodesk AutoCAD when I was 8 and started programming at 11. All of this shaped how I think. I'm a problem solver.

### Ask a question

Asking a question is as easy as
[creating a new issue](https://github.com/dancole/ama/issues/new) on this
project.

I'll try to answer it as soon as I can get to it. Once I answer I'll close the
issue just so I know what I've covered, but don't worry- if you have any further
questions just respond in the thread and I'll get back to you soon. Feel free to
ask a question on any old issue too, even if you didn't create it.
